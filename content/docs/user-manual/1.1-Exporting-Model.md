### How to export
In Blender, look for
`File -> Export -> Starfield Geometry/Morph/Nif`

## Exporting .nif

| Setting | Explanation |
| -- | -- |
| Nif Template | Adviced to read the hover tooltips on each and decide which is more suitable. |
| Export Datatypes: Weights | Affects if vertex groups are exported. For it to export correctly, object should have armature modifier and an armature object linked in the modifier. |
| Export Datatypes: Use Secondary UV | Affects if the second UV should be exported. |
| Additional Data: Physics Node Tree | Affects if the user-created physics node tree should be embedded in the exported nif. |
| Additional Data: Export material | Affects if the material should be exported along with the nif. |
| Special Controls: Use internal geometry data | Affects if the exported nif should be internal geometry (checkmark on) or extendal (checkmark off). Read: [Internal Geometry](/docs/tips/nif#what-is-internal-geometry) |
| Special Controls: Export Head Object | Suitable for headparts. Export model.nif and model_facebones.nif separately if the model has facebone vertex groups. |
| Special Controls: Generate hash names | Export into hex1\hex2.mesh format instead of model_name.mesh |
| Snapping data: Snap Normals To Selected | Experimental snapping of normals from selected objects (reference) to active (exported). |
| Additive Export | Modify only the BSGeometry nodes in imported nif if the selected ExportScene node is from nif import. May raise errors if the number and names of models don't match. If disabled, regular export is used. |
| Additive Export: Overwrite material paths | For additive export, overwrites material paths. |
| After Export: Open folder after export | Opens a folder with exported data after export is complete. |
